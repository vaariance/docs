# EntryPoint Address

The `EntryPointAddress` class represents the address of an EntryPoint contract on the configured `Chain`. It encapsulates the version and the Ethereum address of the EntryPoint contract.

### Properties

- `version`: A `double` representing the version of the EntryPoint contract.
- `address`: An `EthereumAddress` object representing the Ethereum address of the EntryPoint contract.

### Constructors

```dart
EntryPointAddress(double version, EthereumAddress address)
```

Creates a new instance of the `EntryPointAddress` class with the given version and address.

### Static Methods

- `EntryPointAddress.v06`: Returns the EntryPoint address for version 0.6 of the EntryPoint contract.
- `EntryPointAddress.v07`: Returns the EntryPoint address for version 0.7 of the EntryPoint contract.

## Usage

You can use the `EntryPointAddress` class to obtain the address of the EntryPoint contract for a specific version. For example:

```dart
// Get the EntryPoint address for version 0.6
final entrypointv06 = EntryPointAddress.v06;
print(entrypointv06.version); // Output: 0.6
print(entrypointv06.address); // Output: 0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789

// Get the EntryPoint address for version 0.7
final entrypointv07 = EntryPointAddress.v07;
print(entrypointv07.version); // Output: 0.7
print(entrypointv07.address); // Output: 0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032
```

Alternatively, you can create a new instance of the `EntryPointAddress` class by providing the version and address:

```dart
final customEntrypoint = EntryPointAddress(
  8.0,
  EthereumAddress.fromHex('0x...version..8.0'),
);
print(customEntrypoint.version); // Output: 8.0
print(customEntrypoint.address); // Output: '0x...version..8.0'
```

The `EntryPointAddress` class is useful when you need to interact with different versions of the EntryPoint contract or when you want to specify a custom EntryPoint address. By default, the `Chain` class is configured with the EntryPoint addresses for version 0.6 or 0.7, depending on the network you're using. However, if you need to use a custom EntryPoint address, you can easily set it on the `Chain` instance.

```dart
final chain = Chains.getChain(Network.ethereum);

// Set the custom EntryPoint address on the chain
chain.entrypoint = customEntrypoint;
```

After setting the custom EntryPoint address, any interactions with the blockchain through the `Chain` instance will use the specified custom EntryPoint contract address.
This feature can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

1. Testing with a locally deployed EntryPoint contract during development.
2. Using a custom or forked version of the EntryPoint contract.
3. Migrating to a newer version of the EntryPoint contract that is not yet included in the predefined configurations.
