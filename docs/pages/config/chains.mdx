# Configuring Networks and Chains

A convenient way to configure and work with different EVM networks and their corresponding chain configurations. The `Chain` class represents a specific chain, and the `Chains` class offers a predefined set of popular networks and their chain configurations.

## The Chain Class

The `Chain` class encapsulates the configuration details of a specific EVM network. It includes the following properties:

1. `chainId`: The unique identifier of the chain.
2. `explorer`: The URL of the block explorer for this chain.
3. `entrypoint`: The address of the EntryPoint contract on this chain.
4. `accountFactory`: The address of the AccountFactory contract on this chain (required).
5. `jsonRpcUrl`: The URL of the JSON-RPC endpoint for this chain.
6. `bundlerUrl`: The URL of the bundler service for this chain.
7. `paymasterUrl`: The URL of the paymaster service for this chain (optional).
8. `testnet`: A boolean flag indicating whether the chain is a testnet.

You can create a new instance of the `Chain` class by providing the required properties:

```dart
final chain = Chain(
  chainId: 1,
  explorer: 'https://etherscan.io',
  entrypoint: EntryPointAddress('0x...'),
  accountFactory: EthereumAddress('0x...'),
  jsonRpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/...',
  bundlerUrl: 'https://bundler.example.com',
  paymasterUrl: 'https://paymaster.example.com',
);
```

## The Chains Class

The `Chains` class provides a predefined set of popular EVM networks and their corresponding chain configurations. You can obtain the `Chain` instance for a specific network using the `getChain` method:

```dart
final mainnetChain = Chains.getChain(Network.ethereum);
final sepoliaChain = Chains.getChain(Network.sepolia);
```

The `Network` enum represents the available networks, including:

- Mainnet networks: `ethereum`, `polygon`, `optimism`, `base`, `arbitrum`, `linea`, `fuse`, `scroll`
- Testnets: `sepolia`, `baseTestnet`

Each predefined network has its corresponding chain configuration, including the `chainId`, `explorer`, `jsonRpcUrl`, and `entrypoint` address.
You can access other chain-specific constants, such as contract addresses, through the `Constants` class:

```dart
import 'package:variance_dart/variance_dart.dart';

final entrypointv06Address = Constants.entrypointv06;
final simpleAccountFactoryAddressv07 = Constants.simpleAccountFactoryAddressv07;
```

## Usage

```dart
final mainnetChain = Chains.getChain(Network.ethereum); // [!code focus]

final walletFactory = SmartWalletFactory(mainnetChain, signer);

final salt = Uint256.zero;
final wallet = await walletFactory.createSafeAccount(salt);

print("wallet created ${wallet.address.hex} ");
```
