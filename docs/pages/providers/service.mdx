# Providers

Providers are responsible for interacting with Ethereum nodes and bundlers. They enable sending raw RPC calls and facilitate communication between a flutter app and the Ethereum network. Three main providers: Base RPC, Bundler Provider, and JSONRPC Provider are included.

## Base RPC Service

The RPC Service is the foundation that the `Bundler` Provider and `JSONRPC` Provider use to send raw `RPC` calls to Ethereum nodes. It provides a simple and consistent interface for making RPC requests and handling responses.

The Base RPC extends the `JsonRPC` class and serves as the base class for `RPC` communication. It takes a URL as a parameter, which represents the endpoint of the Ethereum node or bundler to interact with.

### Constructor

```dart
RPCBase(String url)
```

Creates a new instance of the `RPCBase` class with the specified URL.

### Methods

1. **send**

```dart
Future<T> send<T>(String function, [List<dynamic>? params])
```

Asynchronously sends an RPC call to the Ethereum node for the specified function and parameters.

#### Parameters:

- `function`: The Ethereum RPC function to call (e.g., `eth_getBalance`).
- `params`: Optional parameters for the RPC call.

### Returns:

A `Future` that completes with the result of the RPC call.

Example:

```dart
var result = await send<String>('eth_getBalance', ['0x9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef98765432']);
```

## Usage

To use the RPC Service, you need to create an instance of the `RPCBase` class with the desired URL:

```dart
final rpcService = RPCBase('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-api-key');
```

Once you have an instance of the RPC Service, you can make RPC calls using the `send` method:

```dart
final balance = await rpcService.send<String>('eth_getBalance', ['0x9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef98765432']);
print('Account balance: $balance');
```
