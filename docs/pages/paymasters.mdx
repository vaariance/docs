# Paymasters

Paymasters are a crucial component of the account abstraction model, enabling the decoupling of transaction fee payment from user accounts. In this documentation page, we'll delve deeper into the technical aspects of Paymasters, exploring their functions, workflow, and potential use cases.

## The Role of Paymasters

In the traditional Ethereum model, users must hold and manage Ether (ETH) in their accounts to pay for transaction fees (gas). However, this requirement can create friction and pose barriers to entry, especially for non-technical users or those without prior experience with cryptocurrencies.

Paymasters aim to solve this problem by acting as intermediaries that handle the payment of transaction fees on behalf of user accounts. This decoupling of fee payment from user accounts simplifies the user experience and opens up new possibilities for fee models and sponsorship schemes.
